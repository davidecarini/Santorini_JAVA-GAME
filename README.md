## DESCRIPTION GAME BOARD
Santorini is an abstract strategy board game for 2-4 players designed and released in 2004 by Gordon Hamilton and republished via Kickstarter in 2016 by Roxley Games. Inspired by the architecture of cliffside villages on Santorini Island in Greece, and primarily designed for two players, the game is played on a 5x5 grid of squares where each turn players build a town by placing building pieces up to three levels high. 

#### OBJECT OF THE GAME
The object of the game is to win by either moving a builder to stand on the third level above the base of the board, or alternatively to manouver so your opponent cannot move on his turn.
